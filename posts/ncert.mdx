# Welcome to my blog!

This post is written in **MDX**.  
You can even use React components:

## Python COde üêç

```python filename="example.js" {2,4}
# Sample inputs (# note: The values given in the prefix code(grey) will be changed by the autograder according to the testcase while running them.
a = 5
b = 6
price, discount_percent = 80, 5.75
total_mins = 470
# <eoi>

output1 = a + b # int: sum of a and b
output2 = 2 * (a + b) # int: twice the sum of a and b
output3 = abs(a - b) # int: absolute difference between a and b
output4 = abs((a + b) - (a * b)) # int: absolute difference between sum and product of a and b

# Find discounted price given price and discount_percent
# input variables : price: int, discount_percent: float
discounted_price = price * (1 - discount_percent / 100) # float

# Round the discounted_price
rounded_discounted_price = round(discounted_price) # int

# Find hrs and mins given the total_mins
# input variables : total_mins
hrs = total_mins // 60 # int: hint: think about floor division operator
mins = total_mins % 60 # int
```

### HELLO üßä


<Calculator a={5} b={6} />


```js filename="example.js" {1,3-4}
console.log("Line 1");
console.log("Line 2");
console.log("Line 3");
console.log("Line 4");
```


- Use `{1,3-4}` to highlight lines 1, 3, and 4.
- Use `filename="example.js"` to show the file name.

---

```js {2,4-5}
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = a + b;
console.log(c);
```

**Summary:**  
- Update your rehype-pretty-code options for line numbers, highlights, and file name.
- Add the provided Tailwind/CSS styles.
- Use code block meta in your MDX for line highlights and file name.

This will give you beautiful, responsive, and feature-rich code blocks in your



```js filename="example.js" {2,4}
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = a + b;
console.log(c);
```
